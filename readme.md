This project introduces a novel human-in-the-loop deep learning pipeline aimed at enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of cancer cell segmentation in digital pathology. By incorporating per-pixel and local-level model uncertainty, the pipeline provides valuable insights into model limitations, enabling pathologists to make more informed diagnoses. Our results demonstrate that using fewer annotated samples can still yield higher segmentation performance when focusing on out-of-domain areas identified by model uncertainty
